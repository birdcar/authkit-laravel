## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: ShareWorkOSData first — active failure mode (unimplemented alias) with no upstream dependencies
- Init: Testing utilities before workbench — workbench tests depend on WorkOS::fake()
- Init: Smart Install before workbench — workbench depends on clean install flow
- Init: CI/CD + README last — README cannot be comprehensive until all features exist

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Verify exact prop surface (user, org, roles, permissions, impersonation) against workbench frontend before implementing ShareWorkOSData
- Phase 3: `--mini` flag behavior needs precise definition before implementation
- Phase 4: Admin Portal intent list needs WorkOS docs check before implementing workbench UI
